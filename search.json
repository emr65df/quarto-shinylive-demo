The error message will resemble the following:\nERROR:\nThe shinylive extension must be used in a Quarto project directory\n(with a _quarto.yml file).\nEnsure that the contents of the _quarto.yml file match the following structure:\nproject:\n  title: \"R-shinylive-demo\"\nHere, the title field should contain the name of the Quarto file up to the extension."

    "text": "Including the Shiny App in Your Quarto Document\nStep 4: To include a Shiny app directly in your Quarto file (.qmd), you need to add a filter key for shinylive at the top of the desired Quarto file. Open your Quarto file and add the following YAML header:\nfilters:\n  - shinylive\nStep 5: You can insert the code for a Shiny application in a code block marked with {shinylive-r}. Below is a skeletal example of how your code block might look:\n---\ntitle: \"Our first r-shinylive Quarto document!\"\nfilters:\n  - shinylive\n---\n\n```{shinylive-r}\n#| standalone: true\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define your Shiny UI here\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  # Your UI components go here\n)\n\n# Define your Shiny server logic here\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  # Your server code goes here\n}\n\n# Create and launch the Shiny app\nshinyApp(ui, server)\n```\nPlease note that the code block must include #| standalone: true, which indicates that the code represents a complete standalone Shiny application. In the future, Quarto will hopefully support Shiny applications with parts spread throughout the document.\nFor an example file, you can refer to this bare-bones implementation: template-r-shinylive.qmd\nWith this in mind, let’s use Joe’s shiny app inside our code block. So, we’ll end up using:\n```{shinylive-r}\n#| standalone: true\n#| viewerHeight: 600\nlibrary(shiny)\nlibrary(bslib)\n\n# Define UI for app that draws a histogram ----\nui &lt;- page_sidebar(\n  sidebar = sidebar(open = \"open\",\n    numericInput(\"n\", \"Sample count\", 100),\n    checkboxInput(\"pause\", \"Pause\", FALSE),\n  ),\n  plotOutput(\"plot\", width=1100)\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  data &lt;- reactive({\n    input$resample\n    if (!isTRUE(input$pause)) {\n      invalidateLater(1000)\n    }\n    rnorm(input$n)\n  })\n  \n  output$plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    hist(data(),\n      breaks = 40,\n      xlim = c(-2, 2),\n      ylim = c(0, 1),\n      lty = \"blank\",\n      xlab = \"value\",\n      freq = FALSE,\n      main = \"\"\n    )\n    \n    x &lt;- seq(from = -2, to = 2, length.out = 500)\n    y &lt;- dnorm(x)\n    lines(x, y, lwd=1.5)\n    \n    lwd &lt;- 5\n    abline(v=0, col=\"red\", lwd=lwd, lty=2)\n    abline(v=mean(data()), col=\"blue\", lwd=lwd, lty=1)\n\n    legend(legend = c(\"Normal\", \"Mean\", \"Sample mean\"),\n      col = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"blue\"),\n      lty = c(1, 2, 1),\n      lwd = c(1, lwd, lwd),\n      x = 1,\n      y = 0.9\n    )\n  }, res=140)\n}\n\n# Create Shiny app ----\nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\n```\nYou can view a standalone version of Joe’s app here: R-shinylive-demo.qmd"

There are multiple options for publishing with Quarto, and we’ll present two of them. Choose the option that best suits your needs for sharing and distributing your Quarto document with your embedded shinylive app.\nOption 1: Publish to GitHub Pages\nTo make your Quarto document accessible on GitHub Pages via Quarto, use the following command in your terminal:\nquarto publish gh-pages\nThis option is great if you want to share your document through a GitHub Pages website.\nOption 2: Publish to Quarto Pub\nAlternatively, you can publish your Quarto document on Quarto Pub via Quarto. Use the following command in your terminal:\nquarto publish quarto-pub\nThis option provides you with a shareable link for easy access by others and is a good choice if you prefer a dedicated platform for your documents.\n\nA Quick Fix for Service Worker Inclusion\nIf you’ve encountered issues with the quarto publish command not including the required service worker JavaScript file, you can quickly resolve this by adding the following lines under the html key in your document header:\nformat:\n  html:\n    resources: \n      - shinylive-sw.js\nThis addition ensures that the necessary service worker JavaScript file (shinylive-sw.js) is included when you publish your Quarto document. The Quarto team is aware of the issue regarding service workers not being uploaded automatically from extensions.\nIf you encounter this issue, you may see an error message in your browser’s JavaScript console that looks like:\nUncaught Error: ServiceWorker controller was not found!\nThe above error occurred in the &lt;Viewer&gt; component:\nBy implementing this quick fix, you can prevent this error and ensure the proper functioning of your shinylive app within your Quarto document."

    "text": "Advanced (Optional Step): Continuous Publishing Using GitHub Actions\nFor advanced users, you can set up continuous integration (CI) to automatically update your application whenever changes are committed to the Quarto document. This process involves creating a workflow for GitHub Actions and utilizing actions from r-lib/actions (for R installation) and quarto-dev/quarto-actions (for Quarto setup and publishing).\nFollow these steps to configure continuous publishing:\nStep 1: Create a .github/ folder in your repository if it doesn’t already exist. Place the workflows/ folder inside it. Then, create a workflow configuration file called publish-website.yml with the following content:\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main, master]\n  release:\n    types: [published]\n  workflow_dispatch:\n\nname: demo-website\n\njobs:\n  demo-website:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    concurrency:\n      group: pkgdown-${{ github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.run_id }}\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n    steps:\n      - name: \"Check out repository\"\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: \"Setup R\"\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2\n\n      - name: \"Setup R dependencies for Quarto's knitr engine\"\n        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2\n        with:\n          packages:\n            any::shinylive\n            any::knitr\n            any::rmarkdown\n            any::downlit\n            any::xml2\n\n      - name: \"Set up Quarto\"\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2\n\n      - name: \"Render and Publish\"\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\nStep 2: Before deploying the action, use the quarto publish gh-pages command to set up the necessary gh-pages branch and repository GitHub Pages settings. This ensures that GitHub Actions can publish your Quarto document correctly.\nBy implementing this advanced setup, your Quarto document with the embedded shinylive app will automatically update whenever changes are pushed to the specified branches or when a release is published. This ensures that your audience always has access to the latest version of your interactive document."
